1. docker build -t peatio:base .
2. ./docker/bin/base.sh
3. ./docker/bin/webapp.sh

IMPORTANT!
The configurations in docker/conf folder are not set properly!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run this command to go inside of a running container with app:

  docker exec -it webapp /bin/bash

You can run migrations and assets precompilation there.
Or you can run these commands and don't go inside of the container:

  docker-bash webapp bash -lc 'cd /home/app/peatio/; RAILS_ENV=production ./bin/rake db:migrate;'
  docker-bash webapp bash -lc 'cd /home/app/peatio/; RAILS_ENV=production ./bin/rake assets:precompile;'

I took those commands from docker/bin/webapp.sh.
They are commented in that file for debug purposes.
